# Assessment 01 Horiseon Refactoring

This code has been refactored to include semantic structure, and functions as intended as well. Several changes were made to achieve this including using practical classes and semantic elements such as: header, main, section, nav and footer. Below are a screenshot of the deployed website and a link to its URL.
